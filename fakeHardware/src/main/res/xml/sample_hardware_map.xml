    <!--

    NOTE: The name “Expansion Hub Portal 1” is what the FTC robot controller
    will call this if you scan for it, so leave it set to this value for
    consistency.

    You can retrieve the serial number value of the hub by configuring
    it from the robot controller phone, and taking note of the value
    found there. We always put that serial number (and the port numbers)
    on a label somewhere visible on the hub - to make it straightforward
    to swap in case one becomes damaged.

    If you need to use two REV expansion hubs, you will need to change
    the port number of at least one to something other than the default
    value of ‘2’, see the documentation from FIRST on how to do this at

    https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/skystone/wiki/Using-Two-Expansion-Hubs

    Everywhere that [...] appears, is a value that you must provide:

    * For serial numbers, this must match the value in the physical
    hardware.

    * For a control hub, on the LynxUsbDevice element, the serial number must be
    "(embedded)", the parent module address is as given by the control hub
    itself, but is "2" by default.

    * For port numbers, this must match the actual physical socket
    on the REV hub

    * For names, any value may be used. We always use the same name
    in the XML file, as is used for the variable in Java that refers
    to the physical hardware. We have found that this makes it easier
    to keep things straight.

            DC Motors

            The "port" value refers to the physical port where the motor
            is connected to the REV expansion hub, numbered 0 - 3.

            The element named "Motor" is generic, but it will not set
            tuned PID(F) values for the type of motor plugged into the hub.

            You will observe more consistent velocity PID (RUN_WITH_ENCODERS)
            or RUN_TO_POSITION behavior if you can use the specific motor types
            provided by the SDK.

            In this first example, you'll notice a color comment. We've found
            that it is very helpful to use wire marking tape on the ports on
            the expansion hub, the cables that plug into them, both sides
            of any connections between the hub and the device, and the devices
            itself. It makes it very easy to identify what to check or replace
            when something is not working correctly.

            Servos are pretty straightforward. Ports are numbered 0-5

            Configuring a servo as a ContinuousRotationServo in this file
            will present an interface in software that "feels" more like a
            DCMotor for servos that are, or are able to be put into continuous
            rotation mode.

            See com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware.CRServo in the SDK for more
            details.

            Digital Devices on REV hubs look like this.

            REV's magnetic limit switch (http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1462/)
            sends output voltage on 'n' and 'n+1', so odd or even port
            numbers work for the same sensor.

            However, REV's touch sensor, which can either be configured as
            a plain "DigitalDevice" or "RevTouchSensor" always sends on n+1,
            so that will always be an odd port number.

            Since we don't use any of REV's splitter cables on our robots,
            we try and always use the odd port number in case we switch
            one type of sensor out for the other.

            If you're attaching something else to your REV Hub to the digital
            I/O ports, check your spec sheet for which pin will send output
            signal, and set "port" appropriately.

            I2C Devices

            Bus numbers (sockets on the hub) run from 0 to 3. An I2C device
            plugged into the physical socket labeled "0" on the hub should use
            port="1" and bus="0". I2C devices plugged into sockets labeled 1-3
            on the hub should use port="0" and bus="[socket number on hub]"
